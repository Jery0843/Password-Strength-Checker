# Password Strength Checker

This Python script evaluates the strength of passwords by analyzing their complexity and uniqueness. It calculates password entropy to gauge complexity and checks against a list of commonly used passwords to ensure uniqueness. The script provides users with immediate feedback on their password's strength and suggestions for improvement.

## Features

- **Entropy Calculation**: Determines password complexity through entropy, considering character diversity and frequency.
- **Common Password Verification**: Checks the password against a predefined list of common passwords to discourage easily guessable passwords.
- **Strength Evaluation and Feedback**: Offers a strength rating (Weak, Moderate, Strong) and provides actionable advice on how to enhance password security.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Installation

No additional installation is required, just ensure Python 3.x is correctly installed.

### Running the Script

1. Save the script in a file, for example, `password_strength_checker.py`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script with the command: `python password_strength_checker.py`.
5. Follow the prompt to enter a password for strength evaluation.

## How It Works

The script conducts several checks to evaluate the password's strength:

1. **Length and Character Diversity**: Checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
2. **Entropy Analysis**: Calculates the password's entropy based on character frequency and variety, where higher entropy indicates a stronger password.
3. **Common Password Check**: Compares the password against a list of commonly used passwords, suggesting avoidance of such passwords.
4. **Feedback**: Provides a strength rating and detailed recommendations for improving password security if necessary.

## Example

Input:

Enter your password to check its strength: Example@Password123!

Output:
Password Strength: Strong
Your password is strong. No recommendations needed.
